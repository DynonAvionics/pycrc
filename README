Copyright of the generated source code
======================================

Prior to v0.6, pycrc was released under the GPL and an additional addition to
the licence was required to permit to use the generated source code in products
with a OSI unapproved licence. Since version 0.6, pycrc is released under the
terms of the MIT licence and thus such an additional clause to the licence has
become obsolete.
