This directory contains the pycrc general purpose CRC utility and C source file
generator. See http://www.tty1.net/pycrc/ for more details.

See the file doc/FAQ for frequently asked questions.


Installation
============

pycrc requires Python 2.2.3 or later.

This program doesn't need any particular installation. You may execute the
script from any directory. On UN*X platforms, you might need to make the script
executable: chmod +x pycrc.py


If you have questions about using pycrc and the documentation does
not answer them, please send mail to <tehpeh@gmx.net>.


Copyright of the generated source code
======================================

Prior to v0.6, pycrc was released under the GPL and an additional addition to
the licence was required to permit to use the generated source code in products
with a OSI unapproved licence. Since version 0.6, pycrc is released under the
MIT licence and thus such an additional clause to the licence has become
obsolete.
